Version 1.0 -- 16 September 1993
Version 1.1 -- 7 January 1994
-  Fixed bug in the coding of metarules
-  Improved debugging of continuation stack inconsistencies
-  Added -V flag
-  Fixed bug in the coding of the startrule
-  Fixed some spelling errors in the user documentation
Version 1.2 -- 1 March 1994
-  Fixed horrible bug in memory management during meta rule analysis
-  Added left recursion detection in meta rules
-  Added the predicate 'not in reserved word list' to the standard library
-  Increased support for user defined libraries
Version 1.3 -- 26 March 1994
-  Added the cut operator '->' to cut off alternatives in topdown parsers
-  Added the predicate 'string to int' to the standard library
Version 1.4 -- 30 April 1994
-  Improved runtime error messages by coding lookahead failures
-  Added a certain controlled degree of polymorfism
-  Added the predicate 'dump affix' to the standard library
Version 1.5 -- 5 April 1998
-  Complete rewrite of the generator and libraries into ANSI C.
-  The generator has been rewritten to generate ANSI C code.
-  Fixed two bugs in the leftcorner parser generator.
-  Deleted the obsolete lookahead syntax (? member) from EAG
-  Added the predicate 'power' to the standard library
Version 1.6 -- June 1998
-  Removed some arbitrary limitations in the eag parser
-  Added removal of unreachable rules and meta rules
-  Combined leftrecursion detection with leftcorner relation calculation
-  Improved the generated leftcorner parsers by encoding the lc relation.
   (Leftcorner parsers went from O(e^(n^2)) to O(e^n) and are now a little bit
   faster than topdown parsers)

Version 2.0 -- February 2000

Version 2.3 -- February 2002
-  Update of all libraries to ease autoconfed installation
Version 2.4 -- December 2002
-  Source code now under CVS control at twoquid.cs.kun.nl:/home/cvs
