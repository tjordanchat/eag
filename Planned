The EAG compiler and its libraries will head off into two seperate
directions:

Version 3.0 will be directed towards a syntactical (but not a
semantical) unification of the three affix formalisms EAG, AGFL
and CDL3. In particular tuple types will be replaced by the term
types already present in CDL3. 

However both versions of EAG will use the same runtime system. They
will therefore be provided as two compilers in the same package.
