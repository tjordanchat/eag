\chapter {Future Work}
The \EAG compiler and its runtime system will head off into two seperate
directions. Version 2.2 will include a lexicon interface that will
considerably improve the usage of \EAG for parsing natural languages.
Version 3.0 (already partly present in the subdirectory \verb+gen3+)
will be directed towards a syntactical (but not semantical) unification
of the three affix formalisms \EAGns, \AGFL and \CDLns. In particular
tuple types will be replaced by the term types already present in \CDLns. 

However, both versions of \EAG will use the same runtime system. They
will therefore be provided as two compilers in the same package.
