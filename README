This is the (intermediate) version 2.5 of EAG. If you encounter any problems
while compiling or testing EAG, do hesitate to email me (marcs@cs.kun.nl)
and I will try and correct the problems.

To install the Extended Affix Grammar environment, you will need the following
GNU tools:

  - gcc
  - make (the GNU make, check with --version)
  - the X11 window system
    (needed only if you want to generate syntax directed editors;
     if you do not need it add --without-x when configuring)

All of these tools are available from a large number of ftp-sites.
Since the source code has been GNU-ified recently, installation
proceeds acoording to the usual GNU paradigma:

  - configure --prefix=<wherever you want to install EAG; default:/usr/local>
  - make
  - make install

The software has been tested on the following platforms:

  Platform		OS		Comments
  - Sun SPARCstation-20	Solaris 2.7
  - SGI			IRIX 6.5
  - i686		Linux 2.2.19	Debian
  - i686		FreeBSD2.6
  - Alpha		NetBSD1.6	libtool pecularities
					(use --disable-shared or link by hand)

In the subdirectory 'examples', several representative examples may be found.
An other subdirectory called 'exp' provides more experimental ones.
